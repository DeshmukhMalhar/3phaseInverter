"#3 Phase Inverter on STM32F103C series" 

This was a project started thinking we will be able to build a 3 phase inverter on STM32F103C8T6, Blue Pill board. The phase drivers will be N ch mosfets (for transformer) of some IGBTs (for transformer-less,direct) forming push-pull drivers.
For driving Mosfets, we were thinking to use IR2104 or similar device

However due to other projects, I was unable to continue this project
In futur, I may come back to this project
